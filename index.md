## Welcome to My Website

Here I will be linking to some of my programming adventures and maybe write up some informational posts.

### About me:

I am currently a Junior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am interested in everything having to do with computers and
this website will be used to document my learning journey.

### Projects:
Here I will link to personal projects.
*Please keep in mind, some may be a work in progress as I do this in my free time.*

- Image Filter Creator: [Project](https://newviewgames.github.io/filterCreatorMinimized/), [Dev Log](/projectRemarks/filterCreator.md)
  - Mess aroung with changing the RGB values of every pixel based on a user input formula for each color channel.
  - I am working on learning webGL in order to speed up the process as currently large images take forever. I will keep the javascript version as a fallback.

- More on the way
