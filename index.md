## Welcome to My Website

Here I will be linking to some of my programming adventures and maybe write up some informational posts.

### About me:

I am currently a Junior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am interested in everything having to do with computers and
this website will be used to document my learning journey.

## Projects:
Here I will link to personal projects. There's always more on the way!
*Please keep in mind, some may be a work in progress as I do this in my free time.*

### WebDev:
- Image Filter Creator: [Try It!](https://newviewgames.github.io/filterCreatorMinimized/), [Dev Log](/projectRemarks/filterCreator.md)
  - Mess aroung with changing the RGB values of every pixel based on a user input formula for each color channel. Gives very interesting visual effects.
  - Written in HTML, JS, CSS, and WebGL

### Blender:
- Ambigram Creator:
  - A python addon to create simple 3D ambigrams
  - Primarily to learn how to interact with the Blender API and keep me interested while doing so
### Godot:
- A few game ideas in the works. I'll update this when I have something near a final product.
