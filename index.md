## Welcome to My Website

Here I will be linking to some of my programming experience and occasionally write up informational posts.

### About me:

I am currently a Senior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am interested in everything having to do with computers and
this website will be used to document my learning journey.

## Projects:
Here I will link to personal projects. There's always more on the way!
*Please keep in mind, some may be a work in progress as I do this in my free time.*
